The site http://www.fbrss.com somehow provides rss feeds for the people and pages you subscribe to on facebook. It's cumbersome to add hundreds of feeds manually to your preffered RSS reader, so I made a couple python scripts to create two opml files (friends and pages), so you can import them at once.

Step 1:
Log in to http://www.fbrss.com with your facebook info.

Step 2:
Copy the friends/pages links into LibreOffice Calc and SaveAs friends.html/pages.html.

Step 3:
Download the python scripts friends.py/pages.py and prefix.txt to the same folder you've saved friends.html/pages.html to.

Step 4:
Run friends.py/pages.py.

Step 5:
Upload friends.opml/pages.opml to your favourite RSS reader. Enjoy!
